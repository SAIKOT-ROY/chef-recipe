                </h2>
                <p>When developing a React application, youâ€™ll need to structure and define your props to avoid bugs and errors. Just like a function might have mandatory arguments, a React component might require a prop to be defined, otherwise, it will not render properly. Forgetting to pass a required prop into a component that needs it could cause your app to behave unexpectedly.</p>

                <p>A custom hook is a way to create reusable logic that can be shared across multiple components, just like a component is a way to create reusable UI elements that can be shared across multiple pages.</p>
